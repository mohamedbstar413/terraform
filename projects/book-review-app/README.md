## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates provisioning a **3-tier web application** using **Terraform** and **AWS** services.

The application architecture:

- **Frontend Tier** — React static site hosted on S3.
- **Backend Tier** — EC2 instances serving backend logic, behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
- **Database Tier** — AWS RDS instance storing application data.

Additional AWS services include: S3, ALB, Auto Scaling Groups, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, SNS, and SQS.

## 🛠 Features

### **Infrastructure as Code**
- Complete AWS infrastructure provisioned via Terraform.
- Terraform state stored securely in S3 with locking enabled.

### **Frontend**
- S3 bucket hosting React frontend as a static website.
- Dynamic ALB DNS written to a file and uploaded to frontend S3 bucket for backend connectivity.

### **Backend**
- S3 bucket storing backend code.
- EC2 instances download backend code on launch using User Data scripts.
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with policies for load management.
- IAM Role for backend EC2 to access AWS services securely.

### **Networking**
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) for request routing.
- Target Group linked to backend EC2 instances.

### **Database**
- RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL instance.
- AWS Secrets Manager storing database credentials securely.

### **Monitoring & Scaling**
- CloudWatch Alarms trigger auto-scaling of backend EC2 instances.

### **Messaging**
- SNS Topic for review notifications.
- SQS queue for queued review messages.
- Email subscription to SNS for notifications.

## ⚙️ AWS Services Used

| Service                | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| S3                     | Static website hosting, backend code storage, Terraform state backend |
| EC2                    | Backend application servers |
| Auto Scaling Group    | Auto-scale backend instances |
| Application Load Balancer | Routes traffic to backend instances |
| RDS                    | Database tier |
| Secrets Manager       | Secure DB credentials storage |
| CloudWatch            | Monitoring and scaling triggers |
| SNS                    | Review notifications |
| SQS                    | Review message queue |
| IAM Roles/Policies    | Secure access management |

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Terraform Provisioning**  
   Terraform provisions all AWS resources and stores state in an S3 bucket for safety.

2. **Frontend Hosting**  
   React build uploaded to an S3 bucket as a static site. ALB DNS file is uploaded for dynamic backend access.

3. **Backend Provisioning**  
   EC2 instances in ASG download backend code on creation via User Data. Instances registered in ALB target group.

4. **Database Access**  
   EC2 instances fetch database credentials securely from Secrets Manager.

5. **Scaling**  
   CloudWatch monitors metrics and triggers scaling actions.

6. **Notifications**  
   SNS delivers review notifications to SQS queue and sends emails to subscribers.
